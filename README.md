# LiveWires Tech 2020

Welcome to LiveWires Tech 2020.

This year things are a bit different, and you're having to use your own computers. 
You should have been emailed the tech activities you'll be doing throughout the week. 
Please follow the guides for the relevant tech so you can arrive set up and ready to go. 

For support, if anything is not working or unclear, please use Slack, or email tech@livewires.org.uk.

## Hardware

You should only need your computer or laptop. For 3D graphics we highly recommend that you have a mouse rather than just using a laptop trackpad. 

## Tech Activities

### Coding

Coding simply uses a web browser. We've used Chrome when writing the worksheets, so we recommend installing 
[Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/), or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/), which should also work. 

### 3D Graphics

We'll be using Blender. [Click here for our setup guide](https://github.com/livewires/graphics/blob/master/installation.md).

### Sound Production

We'll be using Reaper, and some project files that we've put together. Check out the [setup guide here](https://github.com/livewires/audio-production)

### Video Production
